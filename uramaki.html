	<h2>Uramaki Roll</h2>
    <p>Uramaki sushi is a type of sushi that originated in the United States and has since become popular around the world.
	It is also known as an inside-out roll because the rice is on the outside of the seaweed wrapper, with the filling on the inside. 
	The rice is seasoned with vinegar, sugar, and salt and is typically mixed with ingredients such as sesame seeds, avocado, or cucumber.
	The filling can include raw or cooked seafood, vegetables, or other ingredients such as tofu or egg.

The seaweed wrapper is usually coated with sesame seeds or tobiko (flying fish roe) for added texture and flavor. Uramaki sushi is often served with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger on the side.</p>

		<li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon salt</li>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
		<li>Rinse the sushi rice in a fine mesh strainer and place it in a pot with 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed.</li>
		<li>In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat over low heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.</li>
		<li>Transfer the cooked rice to a large bowl and pour the vinegar mixture over it. Mix gently with a wooden spoon until the rice is evenly coated and the mixture has cooled to room temperature.</li>
		<li>Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat, shiny side down. Spread a thin layer of rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top edge.</li>
		<li>Arrange the avocado, cucumber, carrot, and shrimp on top of the rice in a line, running from left to right.</li>
		<li>Use the bamboo mat to roll the sushi away from you, tucking in the filling as you go. When you reach the top edge, moisten it with water and press to seal the roll.</li>
		<li>Sprinkle the sesame seeds over the top of the roll, and slice it into 8-10 pieces with a sharp knife.</li>
		<li>Serve with wasabi and soy sauce on the side.</li>
      </ol>
