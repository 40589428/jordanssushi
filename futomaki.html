	<h2>Futomaki Roll</h2>
    <p>Futomaki is a type of sushi that is traditionally made with a larger roll than other types of sushi. The word "futomaki" literally means "thick roll" in Japanese. 
	The sushi roll is typically made with seasoned sushi rice and a variety of fillings, which can include cooked or raw seafood, egg, vegetables such as cucumber, pickled daikon radish, and kanpyo (dried gourd strips). The fillings are usually cut into thin strips and placed in the center of the rice before the roll is tightly wrapped with a sheet of nori seaweed. 
	Futomaki is often sliced into thick pieces and served as a meal or snack. It is often eaten on special occasions such as festivals, and it is sometimes served as part of a bento box lunch. Futomaki is also sometimes called "e-ho-maki" in Japan and is traditionally eaten on Setsubun, the day before the beginning of spring, for good luck and fortune.</p>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
<li>Wash the sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Drain the rice and add it to a pot with 2 1/4 cups of water. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked.</li>
		<li>In a small bowl, mix together the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until the sugar and salt have dissolved.</li>
		<li>Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large bowl and add the vinegar mixture. Mix well to combine and let the rice cool to room temperature.</li>
		<li>Take a sheet of nori seaweed and place it on a sushi mat or a piece of plastic wrap. Spread a thin layer of the sushi rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top edge of the nori.</li>
		<li>Place the sliced salmon, cucumber, carrots, avocado, and pickled daikon in a line across the middle of the rice.</li>
		<li>Use the mat or plastic wrap to tightly roll the sushi, starting at the bottom edge and rolling towards the top. Squeeze the roll gently to make sure it is tightly packed.</li>
		<li>Repeat the process with the remaining nori and ingredients until all of the sushi rolls are made.</li>
		<li>Using a sharp knife, slice the sushi rolls into 1-inch thick pieces.</li>
		<li>Serve with wasabi paste and soy sauce.</li>
      </ol>
