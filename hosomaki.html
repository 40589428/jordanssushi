	<h2>Hosomaki Roll</h2>
    <p>Hosomaki is a type of sushi that is made with a small, thin roll of sushi rice and filling wrapped in a sheet of nori seaweed. The word "hosomaki" literally means "thin roll" in Japanese. 
	Hosomaki typically contains only one type of filling, such as tuna, cucumber, or avocado. The filling is usually cut into thin strips and placed in the center of the rice before the roll is tightly wrapped with a sheet of nori seaweed. 
	Hosomaki is often sliced into small, bite-sized pieces and served as an appetizer or as part of a sushi platter. Because of its simple preparation and presentation, it is a popular type of sushi for home cooks to make. Hosomaki is also a good choice for people who are new to sushi, as it typically contains only one type of filling and is easy to eat in small portions.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
		<li>1/2 cup sushi rice</li>
		<li>1/2 cup water</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
		<li>1/2 tablespoon sugar</li>
		<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
		<li>3-4 thin slices of cucumber</li>
		<li>1 sheet of nori</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
		<li>Wash the sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
		<li>Combine the rice and water in a pot and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low. Cook for 18-20 minutes until the rice is tender and the water has been absorbed.</li>
		<li>In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat over low heat until the sugar and salt have dissolved.</li>
		<li>Transfer the cooked rice to a large bowl and add the vinegar mixture. Stir gently to combine.</li>
		<li>Place the nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Spread the rice evenly over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top.</li>
		<li>Arrange the cucumber slices in a single layer on top of the rice, about 1 inch from the bottom edge of the nori.</li>
		<li>Using the sushi mat, roll the nori tightly from the bottom to the top, using your fingers to tuck the filling in as you go.</li>
		<li>Moisten the top border of the nori with a bit of water to help seal the roll.</li>
		<li>Cut the roll into 6-8 pieces using a sharp, wet knife. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger on the side, if desired.</li>
      </ol>
